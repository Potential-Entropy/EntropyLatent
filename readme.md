Simple C++ implementation of blueprint like latent functions such as Delay.<br>
This plugin is based on <a href="https://github.com/landelare/ue5coro">ue5coro</a> and requires it to work.<br>
<br>
The file EntropyLatentDebugActor.cpp in EntropyLatent_Test/Private contains a usage example and a bunch of notes on safety.<br>
In the future, we plan to write a more detailed documentation.<br>
