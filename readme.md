# Entropy Latent

Simple C++ implementation of Unreal Engine Blueprint like latent functions such as Delay.<br>
This plugin is based on <a href="https://github.com/landelare/ue5coro">ue5coro</a> and requires it to work.

## Installation
Download and install <a href="https://github.com/landelare/ue5coro">ue5coro</a> and clone the EntropyLatent repository into your projects plugin folder.<br>
To use EntropyLatent, add the EntropyLatent module as a dependency module to whatever module you want to use it with.<br>
Due to Unreal limitations, you also need to add UE5Coro as a dependency module!

## Usage
The file <a href="https://github.com/Potential-Entropy/EntropyLatent/tree/main/Source/EntropyLatent_Test/Private/EntropyLatentDebugActor.cpp">EntropyLatentDebugActor.cpp</a> in Source/EntropyLatent_Test/Private contains a usage example and a bunch of notes on safety.<br>
In the future, we plan to write a more detailed documentation.
